This folder contains 3D-print-ready cases for the RubberDucky-RPiPico project.  

There are two subfolders:
- `Pi Pico/` — Pi Pico casing (development & testing)  
- `USB Casing/` — USB-style case (final product)


You can print these yourself or contact a 3D printing service to print them for you.

## Pi Pico (development & testing)

**Thingiverse reference:**  
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4737733

For development and testing, I use the **Pi Pico casing** since it fits with a pin header installed on the board.  
This makes it easier to change jumpers between payloads.

**Image example:**

## USB Casing (final product)

**Thingiverse reference:**  
https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5148336

For the final product, I use the **USB-style case** to mimic a real USB drive.

**Image example:**

## Notes
- STL files are included and ready to slice.  
- You can use any 3D printing material (PLA, PETG, etc.) depending on your preference.  
- If you don’t have a 3D printer, contact a local or online printing service and provide the `.stl` files.  
- These models were sourced from Thingiverse (links above) — credit to the original creators.
